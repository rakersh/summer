If there is one thing you should start with today...than it would be: setup an application register to manage the life cycle of all applications. 

Application portfolio management is maybe an outdated concept, we should call these:
- Services
- Producs (or digital products)

Preparation:
1. Inform all stakeholders about the importance of having an integrated view on all services and applications. 
2. Meanwhile, make the salsa. Chop the pepper, olives, parsley and capers, and put into a bowl and mix with the remaining oil and vinegar. Season to taste. When the steaks are cooked, spoon over the salsa and top with flaked almonds to serve.
